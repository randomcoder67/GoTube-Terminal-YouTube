## Installation

### Dependancies

* Firefox
* mpv
* ueberzug
* golang
* yt-dlp

### Install

`git clone https://github.com/randomcoder67/GoTube-YouTube-Client.git`  
`cd GoTube-YouTube-Client`  
`make`  
`make install`  

Log into YouTube in Firefox. Ensure there is a `~/.mozilla/firefox/[something].default-release/` directory. This should be the default save location for the cookies file when Firefox is insatlled using a package manager.
